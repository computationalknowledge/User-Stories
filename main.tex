\begin{enumerate}
    \item Whenever you are working on any program in any programming language more complicated than writing simple for loops and while Loop's you're going to need to think about story is that your program is telling.
    
    \item Useful programs in the real world work by implementing sets of rules called business processes.
    
    \item In later labs we will see how you can specify business processes and a declarative format in the same way that we write SQL or declarative format.
    
    \item Your business processes can be stored in a database this is what we do in real-world complexity programs and IT business applications.
    
    \item In this lab you will see how to write user stories to capture describe and implement the activity flows that your program should perform. At work in the real world you would obtain this by interviewing your users or the clients are writing the software for.
